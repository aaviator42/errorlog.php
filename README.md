# errorlog.php
View and clear `error_log` from your browser.

Simply chuck `errorlog.php` in a folder, and now navigating to the file from a web browser will show the contents of the local `error_log` file and allow you to clear it. 

I find it super handy while debuging PHP backends. 


 > **WARNING:** Only use this script in dev environments, never in production! `error_log` files can contain sensitive information!
